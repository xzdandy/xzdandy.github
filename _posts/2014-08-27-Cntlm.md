##Download: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/cntlm/files/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cntlm/files/)

##Introduction:
NTML authentication is not so friendly to many software and development. Recently I am using python urllib2 to grab information from website. However to configure Corporation's proxy is really annoyed. Finally I use **Cntlm** which stands between your applications and the corporate proxy, adding NTLM authentication on-the-fly. 

##Config:
I recommend to download [**cntlm-0.92.3-win32.zip**](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cntlm/files/cntlm/cntlm%200.92.3/cntlm-0.92.3-win32.zip/download) which you can use cntlm without administration right.

Extract file and open **cntlm.ini**. Basically you only need to change 4 lines.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Username	myname
Domain		mydomain
Password	mypassword
Proxy		ip:port
</pre>
There are also other options that you can change. But these four is enough for us to run cntlm. 

##Run:
There is not much difference to run cntlm on linux or windows. Open the shell and go to the directory you extract cntlm. Then type in following command.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
cntlm.exe -v -c cntlm.ini
</pre>
The proxy should start.

If you don't want to configure the file with your username and passowrd. You can run the command manualy.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
cntlm.exe -fvI -u user@domain -c cntlm.ini
</pre>
Then cntlm will ask you for your password.

##Use:
Default, Cntlm provides proxy at 127.0.0.1:3128. You can also change this in cntlm.ini. You can use CNTLM for any software that can set up proxy. For example, if I want to use python urllib2.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
import urllib2
proxy = urllib2.ProxyHandler({'http': 'http://127.0.0.1:3128'})
opener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy)
urllib2.install_opener(opener)
u = urllib2.urlopen('http://www.example.com/')
data = u.read()
</pre>
When you run this program, if all configuration is right, you can see Cnltm's output.
